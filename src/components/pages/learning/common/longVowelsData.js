They had to put us on the waiting que, my brother and I were so hungry that we started argue. Finally the waiter took us back to our table and served fondue. I put my tissue on my lap and dug in.

    passageContent: 'Last Summer, my mom and dad went one cruise. I packed my suitcase and went to visit my grandma and grandpa on the farm. Grandpa needed my help picking the fruit from his trees. Grandma needed my help making the fruit into juice. One day while I was picking fruit, I fell off the ladder. I got a huge bruise on my leg. Grandpa said we should take a break. I grabbed my swimsuit and we all went down to swim in the pond. Then we had a picnic with fresh fruit and juice.',
